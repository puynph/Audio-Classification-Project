# GTZAN Dataset
For this project, I used the GTZAN Dataset retrieved from Kaggle. The dataset is comprised of 10 genres with 100 audio files each, all lasting 30 seconds. Genres include Classical, Jazz, Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Blues, Country, Disco, Metal, and Reggae. The dataset is available in WAV format. For more info and in order to download it, check out the official [website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification).

To use the dataset, download the file and unzip the folders with the audio tracks here, in the dataset folder. Finally, remove this file from the folder.
